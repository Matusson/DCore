# Introduction
Welcome! DCore is a library which makes creating basic Discord.NET bots quicker and simpler. It provides required, but time-consuming features, such as:
- Account Management (for multiple bot accounts)
- Logging
- Configuration
- Multi-language support 
- and some utilities.

It's very simple to use, and quick start guides as well as full API documentation are available. I recommend you start by reading the guides - they will provide you with the most important information. <br>
There isn't a support server, but feel free to message me on Discord (Matusson#6105) or open an issue on GitHub if you need help, or if you want to suggest anything. <br><br>
Thank you for considering using this library!
